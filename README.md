# Easy Flipper Zero ESP32 Flash
This is for easily flashing Marauder on an ESP32 or WiFi Devboard for a Flipper Zero!

## Windows Users:
You have two prerequisites.  
You must install [Git for Windows from here](https://gitforwindows.org/).  
If you are flashing an ESP32 board, you need to install the [driver from here](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads) in order for your device to be recognized

##  All other users:
You have one prerequisite.  
You need to install `git` however you would on your system if you haven't already.  

## It is now simple to install or update Marauder or Evil Portal on Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows.
# How to use: 
* Ideally use a venv as it's best practice with any Python scripts, although it isn't required (Google it if you don't know what that is)
* Step 0 only has to be ran once. (That doesn't mean it's okay to skip it unless you're running it again after having just used it)
* Steps 1-4 are not necessary on AWOK boards
0) run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. 
1) Press and hold the `BOOT` button on the module
2) While still holding `BOOT`, connect the devboard or ESP32 board via USB.
3) Press and release the `RESET` button.
4) Release the `BOOT` button. 
5) run `python3 EasyInstall.py`. 
6) Select the option of what you want to do

## Using make

```shell
make doctor #make sure you have python
```

```shell
make run #install the requirements and run the installer
```

## This project was based on the Windows Marauder flasher batch script

You can find it [here in UberGuidoZ's repo](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/blob/main/Wifi_DevBoard/FZ_Marauder_Flasher)

## About this script
* There have been MASSIVE changes to how the settings are done for flashing because it started becoming cluttered and this script became too long, but this won't affect usage.  
* This script pulls all of its resources from the proper Github repositories in order to make sure you are up-to-date.  
* The only dependencies it does not get by itself are the required Python modules and Windows tools.  
* This script should work on most devices that can run Python 3 and can access serial ports via USB.  
* Support for Evil Portal has been added!
* As of Marauder Update 0.13.7, there is no more serial bin, it is unified, but the latest Marauder Companion App (7.0) is required to use it on your Flipper

## Compatible boards
* Flipper Zero WiFi Devboard  
* ESP32-S2 (The ESP32 chip that is on the WiFi Devboard)  
* ESP32-S2-WROVER
* ESP32-WROOM
* ESP32 Marauder Mini
* ESP32-S3 
* All AWOK ESP32 Boards

## How to connect an ESP32-WROOM, WROVER, etc to the Flipper Zero
ESP32 -> Flipper Zero  
TX0 -> RX  
RX0 -> TX  
GND -> GND  
3v3 -> 3v3  

## Optional parameters
There are now optional parameters
* `-h` or `--help` - Show help
* `-s` or `--serialport` <Serial Port>  
For example, if you have a device you know is on `/dev/ttyUSB0`, you could specify it with `python3 EasyInstall.py -s /dev/ttyUSB0` or `python3 EasyInstall.py --serialport /dev/ttyUSB0` 
* Using this option will skip automatic detection of the serial port and will not try to identify the device
* `-ps` or `--preselect` - Preselect an option of what you want to flash  
For example, if you want to flash a WiFi Devboard or ESP32-S2 without selecting from the menu, you could use `python3 EasyInstall.py -ps 1` or `python3 EasyInstall.py --preselect 1`  

## Disclaimer:
I am absolutely not resposible if you somehow manage to brick your device with this tool (especially if you did it using optional parameters) and I cannot help you fix it. 

## Issues with flashing?
Here are some steps to try:  
* Since I keep having to tell Windows users on Discord to install Python to use this... YOU HAVE TO INSTALL PYTHON IN ORDER TO USE PYTHON SCRIPTS!! IT'S IN THE WINDOWS STORE!!!  
* Ensure you have followed the steps above and installed any necessary prerequisites
* Check that your computer can see the device. In Linux, run `lsusb`, on Mac run `system_profiler SPUSBDataType`, on Windows, open your Device Manager and look for it
* Try a different cable
* Try a different USB port
* Check your permissions. On Linux, you may have to add yourself to whatever group owns the port. For example, `/dev/ttyUSB0` is typically owned by root and the dialout or uucp group (depending on your distro), find out which by running `ls -la /dev/ttyUSB0`, make note of the user and group that own it, then run `sudo usermod -aG group user` replacing group and user with the correct ones, then log out and back in.  
* Windows users: Can't find or communicate with your ESP32? Again, make sure the driver is installed, see above recommendations.  
* If you're using Windows, don't use Git Bash, it doesn't work well with this script. Instead, use Powershell, Windows Terminal, or CMD
* On Windows and Python is acting strange? Uninstall it then re-install it via the Microsoft Store.
* Make sure you're running the latest Python release! If you're on 3.8 when current is 3.11.3 for example, don't bother opening an issue until after you upgrade and try again. Don't try to use old stuff.
* Still can't get it and don't understand CLI at all and can't even figure out how to cd? What are you even doing? This definitely isn't for you. Try using the ESP Flasher app on your Flipper Zero.  

## Why do I kind of pick on Windows users?
Simply, because Windows users seem to come across the most issues (and to be fair, this was a pain to make work properly in Windows), a lot of which are users not understanding how to use the CLI or not reading this whole page, especially the top section.  

## TODO:
* Even more code cleanup.  
* Add other popular ESP32 firmware
* Maybe an official name change
